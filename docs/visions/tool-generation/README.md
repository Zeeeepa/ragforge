## 🎯 What This System Does

**Generate database query tools automatically from `ragforge.config.yaml`:**

- ✅ Auto-generate tools during `ragforge generate`
- ✅ Expose complete schema (fields, unique IDs, relationships) to agents
- ✅ Support computed fields (line_count, modified_at from change tracking)
- ✅ Separate generic (config-driven) from custom (user-coded) tools
- ✅ Generate specialized tools based on field types (date ranges, number ranges, patterns)
- ✅ Integrate with existing change tracking system

**Result**: Agents know exactly what data exists and how to query it, with zero boilerplate.

## 🔑 Key Concepts

### 1. Config-Driven Tool Generation

**Before** (manual):
```typescript
// Manually code each tool
const tools = [
  { name: 'query_entities', description: '...' },
  // ... tedious manual work
];
```

**After** (automatic):
```yaml
# ragforge.config.yaml
entities:
  - name: Scope
    searchable_fields:
      - name: name
        type: string
```

```bash
$ ragforge generate
✓ Generated client
✓ Generated 8 database tools  # ← Automatic!
✓ Generated tool registry setup
```

### 2. Complete Schema Exposure

Tools automatically document:
- All searchable fields with types and descriptions
- Unique identifiers for each entity
- Available relationships (source → target entity mappings)
- Vector indexes and what fields they cover
- Computed fields (derived from existing data)

### 3. Generic vs Custom Tools

**Generic** (auto-generated, regenerated on every `ragforge generate`):
- `query_entities` - Flexible WHERE/ORDER BY queries
- `semantic_search` - Vector similarity search
- `explore_relationships` - Graph traversal
- `query_entities_by_date_range` - Temporal queries
- `query_entities_by_number_range` - Numeric range filters
- ... auto-generated based on config

**Custom** (user-coded, preserved across regeneration):
```typescript
// generated-client/tools/custom-tools.ts
export const customTools = [
  {
    name: 'calculate_complexity_score',
    // Your domain-specific logic
  }
];
```

### 4. Computed Fields

Define derived values in config:

```yaml
computed_fields:
  - name: line_count
    type: number
    expression: "endLine - startLine"

  - name: modified_at
    type: timestamp
    cypher: |
      OPTIONAL MATCH (n)-[:HAS_CHANGE]->(c:Change)
      WITH n, c ORDER BY c.timestamp DESC LIMIT 1
      RETURN c.timestamp AS modified_at
```

Agents can then query/order by these fields automatically.
